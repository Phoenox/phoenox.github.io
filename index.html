<h2>What is this blog about?</h2>
<p>
  Here, you'll (hopefully) find some interesting stuff regarding clean software development.
  I won't cover programming basics, but focus more on architectures, paradigms, etc.
  From time to time, I'll also present some of the strategies I use to structure my daily work.
  Last but not least, you'll find my various experiments when I want to learn new frameworks, technologies, you name it (no matter if these experiments succeed or not).
