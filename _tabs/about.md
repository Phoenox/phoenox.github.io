Hi, I'm Thomas Eggerling
- aka "That Clean Development Guy"
- aka "PhoeNox" (somehow that gamer handle stuck, what you gonna do?)

While I'm mainly a software developer, I've also been trained as Clean Development Trainer (sounds recursive? It is!)
I have a passion for learning new stuff myself, and sharing that newfound knowledge with others.

When I'm not working, I'm probably doing one of the following things:
* playing a good video game (Deep Rock Galactic, anyone?)
* being the game master for various roleplaying games - although I wouldn't mind
  switching to "just" being a player from time to time
* keeping fit by doing Capoeira
* slacking off on the couch while watching the latest series / movies
